# My Portfolio
## This repo is a list of open-source projects I've created. My main focus is Discord Bots, open-source websites on here might not be up to scratch due to the fact I only tend to work on them for commissions. You will need [node](https://nodoejs.org) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Once you open the folder in something like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) run `npm i` to install the necessary packages.

# Live Links
## This will be added soon & will include bot invites, site links, etc
