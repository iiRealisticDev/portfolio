## My Portfolio
### Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I'll keep a bunch of my open-source projects for potential commissioners to view, as well as screenshots/GIFs of closed-source projects, or links to them where possible.

## Realistic Jr. - Discord Bot
### Realistic Jr. is my verified Discord Bot, and is currently still a WIP as per the newest version. While the source is private for obvious reasons, you may visit the website [here](https://realistic-jr-bot.glitch.me/home) or invite the bot [here](https://top.gg/bot/569205386054467594). It is a multipurpose bot with numerous commands, currently all in slash commands.

## Lava Java Cafe
Lava Java Cafe was one of my first proper website commissions, accompanied with a feature-rich Discord bot.

The [website](https://www.lavajavacafe.info/) features Discord oAuth2 usage for logins, a way to apply for ranks or partnerships **and** a way to appeal bans, as well as a ton of information for the group. 

The bot includes a multitude of commands with aliases, restricted to specific roles and users. ![Commands](https://i.imgur.com/7Qxrega.png)

It also includes a large variety of features, such as message logging, reaction roles, and a simple but useful ticket system as requested. It also has a private API for tons of important stuff, i.e. displaying apps, sending apps, editing apps, ranking users, etc.
