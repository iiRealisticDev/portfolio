## Realistic Jr. - Discord Bot
Realistic Jr. is my verified Discord Bot, and is currently still a WIP as per the newest version. While the source is private for obvious reasons, you may visit the website [here](https://realistic-jr-bot.glitch.me/home) or invite the bot [here](https://top.gg/bot/569205386054467594). It is a multipurpose bot with numerous commands, currently all in slash commands.

## Lava Java Cafe
Lava Java Cafe was one of my first proper website commissions, accompanied with a feature-rich Discord bot.

The [website](https://www.lavajavacafe.info/) features Discord oAuth2 usage for logins, a way to apply for ranks or partnerships **and** a way to appeal bans, as well as a ton of information for the group. 

The bot includes a multitude of commands with aliases, restricted to specific roles and users. ![Commands](https://i.imgur.com/7Qxrega.png)

It also includes a large variety of features, such as message logging, reaction roles, and a simple but useful ticket system as requested. It also has a private API for tons of important stuff, i.e. displaying apps, sending apps, editing apps, ranking users, etc.


## Pricing
Pricing is subject to request, and these are general guidelines for such. I only take payment via PayPal, or PSN Giftcards (must be usable in the UK, check your regions, good places for buying them slightly cheaper where I still get the full amount is [CDKeys](https://www.cdkeys.com).) If your region isn't set to ENG on the website, here's how to do that:

You must pay for hosting, seeing as if I did I'd lose more than I earn.

My preferred method of payment is giftcards, easier for me, cheaper for you.

A general pricing range:
(Check these on CDKeys for how much it'll cost you if we do that way; the prices listed below are minimum in GBP, then minimum in USD based on PayPal's currency convertor. Take the GBP cost of the cards, then add up the cards until you get the minimum cost.)
- Discord Bots: 25GBP+ (32.53USD+)
- Websites: 75GBP+ (97.57USD+)
